  title: BlueConic REST API v2
  description: "Welcome to the [BlueConic](https://www.blueconic.com) REST API v2.\
    \ Our recently updated APIs offer access to a wealth of resources to interact\
    \ with BlueConic visitor profiles, segments, interactions, and audit events via\
    \ OpenAPI and OAuth 2.0 authorization flows making the interconnection between\
    \ various services more secure, intuitive, and reliable than ever before.\n\n\
    This page describes how developers can use OAuth 2.0, the industry-standard protocol\
    \ for authorization, to authorize apps in BlueConic and get started using the\
    \ BlueConic REST API v2.\n\nLearn more about [how to use the BlueConic REST API\
    \ v2](https://support.blueconic.com/hc/en-us/articles/200453891-Using-the-BlueConic-REST-API).\n\
    \n# Authorizing an application to use the BlueConic REST API via OAuth 2.0\n\n\
    If you have an external software application that needs to communicate with BlueConic,\
    \ you need to allow access to the BlueConic REST API. The authorization process\
    \ in BlueConic for this access is built to OAuth 2.0 specifications. You can use\
    \ either of two authorization flows: the authorization code flow and the client\
    \ credentials flow. The most secure flow is the authorization code flow, intended\
    \ for use with a user who can log in to BlueConic and authenticate the application\
    \ to use the BlueConic API. The client credentials flow is easier to implement\
    \ but lacks security features present in the authorization code flow. The client\
    \ credentials flow is intended for machine-to-machine applications. \n\n## Using\
    \ the Authorization code flow\n\nTo use the BlueConic REST API with OAuth 2.0\
    \ according to the authorization code flow you need to complete the following\
    \ steps:\n\n1.  Configure BlueConic so your external OAuth 2.0 application can\
    \ authenticate and use the REST API. This means that you have to:\n    - Have\
    \ a BlueConic user with the \"Applications\" permission. This user can configure\
    \ the details of the external application in BlueConic.\n    - Have a BlueConic\
    \ user with the \"Authorize Applications\" permission. This user can authorize\
    \ the external application via the redirect page served by the authorization server.\n\
    \    - Configure the external application on the BlueConic Access management >\
    \ Applications tab, so BlueConic can store public client ID and the client secret.\
    \ The external app uses these properties to perform the initial request for an\
    \ authorization code.\n\n\n2. Develop an application that can execute OAuth 2.0\
    \ REST API requests. Specifically, that means an application that is able to:\n\
    \    - Generate a code verifier and code challenge.\n    - Store the public client\
    \ ID and client secret as configured in BlueConic (see step 1). \n    - Request\
    \ an authorization code from the BlueConic authorization server. Include the code\
    \ challenge in the request. \n    - Show the user the redirect page served by\
    \ the BlueConic authorization server, so the user can authenticate with credentials\
    \ and consent to giving the application BlueConic REST API access.\n    - Receive\
    \ the authorization code from the BlueConic authorization server.\n    - Use the\
    \ authorization code to request an access token (and refresh token) from the BlueConic\
    \ authorization server. Include the code verifier in the request. You must also\
    \ provide the client ID and client secret for client authentication. You can do\
    \ so by sending the client credentials in the body of your POST request.\n   \
    \ - Use the access token to perform REST API requests. \n    - Revoke access if\
    \ the user of the app so chooses (meaning that after this revocation, a new authorization\
    \ grant is required to use the BlueConic REST API).\n    - Handle refresh token\
    \ rotation. This means that whenever a new access token is requested using the\
    \ refresh token, a new refresh token is also supplied along with the new access\
    \ token.\n    - Handle all possible responses from the BlueConic REST API appropriately.\n\

    \n## Using the Client credentials flow\n\nTo make use of the BlueConic REST API\
    \ with OAuth 2.0 following the client credentials flow, you need to complete the\
    \ following steps:\n\n1. Configure BlueConic so your external OAuth 2.0 application\
    \ can use the REST API. This means that you have to:\n    - Have a user with the\
    \ \"Applications\" permission. This user can configure the details of the external\
    \ application in BlueConic.\n    - Have a user with the \"Authorize Applications\"\
    \ permission, who also has all permissions needed to use the REST API endpoint\
    \ that you intend to use.\n    - Configure the external application on the Access\
    \ management > Applications tab, so BlueConic can generate and store the public\
    \ client ID and client secret for client authentication. Also select at least\
    \ one scope so the app has access to that part of the REST API.\n   \n2. Develop\
    \ an application that can execute OAuth 2.0 REST API requests. Specifically that\
    \ means an application that is able to:\n    - Store the public client ID and\
    \ client secret as configured in BlueConic (see above).\n    - Use the client\
    \ ID and client secret to request an access token from the BlueConic authorization\
    \ server. You can do so by sending the client credentials in the body of your\
    \ POST request.\n    - Use the access token to perform REST API requests.\n  \
    \  - Handle all possible responses from the BlueConic REST API appropriately.\n\

    \n# Using the try-out feature\nThe “Try” feature allows you to directly make REST\
    \ calls to the API server, where you can make requests and see the responses,\
    \ allowing you to experiment with the BlueConic API and understand how it works.\n\
    \nYou can enter your BlueConic URL in the “API Servers” section. After that, you\
    \ can try out the calls that don’t require authentication, such as “Get interactions”\
    . You can enter the request parameters and click “Try”.\n\n## OAuth 2.0 authentication\n\
    \nMost calls require OAuth 2.0 authentication, such as “Get audit events”. This\
    \ can be seen at the right top and under the Request heading of each API method.\
    \ To use the “Try” feature, you need to authenticate via OAuth 2.0. First create\
    \ an Application in your BlueConic tenant (see above). When using the Authorization\
    \ code flow, make sure to set the redirect URL to this tool as specified under\
    \ the OAuth 2.0 authentication section. After you create the Application, authenticate\
    \ this tool in the “Authentication” section. Enter the client ID and client secret\
    \ in the correct OAuth 2.0 flow for which you created the application and press\
    \ “GET TOKEN”. If the tool got a token successfully, you will see the text “API\
    \ key applied” just under the “Authentication” heading. In calls that require\
    \ Authentication, it will say “OAuth (OAuth 2.0) in header”. Now you can use the\
    \ “Try” feature for calls that require OAuth 2.0. If you hover over the authentication\
    \ scheme at the top right of an API method, you will see the required scopes (e.g.\
    \ “Get audit events” has the scope read:audit-events). Make sure you set these\
    \ scopes for the Application in BlueConic.\n\n# General functionality for all\
    \ endpoints\n\n1. By using `prettyPrint`, the JSON data is formatted in a way\
    \ that makes it easier to read and work with. This can be especially useful when\
    \ working with large or complex JSON datasets. Add the following to the query\
    \ string of a request to pretty print JSON: `&prettyPrint=true`.\n2. Gzip encoding\
    \ is a method of compressing data and is commonly used to reduce the size of files\
    \ sent over the Internet. BlueConic supports this so a client can set the request\
    \ header `Accept-Encoding: gzip`. BlueConic will then compress the data in its\
    \ response and send it back to the client with the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header.\

        To update a content store, a request with a JSON object can be sent to the `/contentStores` endpoint via the `PUT` method.
        The JSON object can contain any of the properties that are part of the content store. <br/>
        Partial updates are supported. You only need to supply the properties that you want to change.<br/>
        At least one property needs to be supplied, otherwise a HTTP 400 is returned.

      operationId: createModel
      requestBody:
        description: |-
          To create a model, a `multipart/form-data` request can be sent to the `/models` endpoint via the `POST` method. <br/>
          The request body can contain multiple parts, named as follows: <br/><br/>

          - `metadata`: The metadata for the model. This is a JSON object that contains the model's metadata properties.
          - `model`: The binary ONNX model, serialized as specified in the ONNX [documentation](https://onnx.ai/onnx/api/serialization.html).

          The `model` part is optional and can be updated later using the `PUT /models/{modelId}` endpoint.<br/>
          The `metadata` part is required and must be included in the request.

          ### DIALOGUE models

          When creating a model of type `DIALOGUE`, the `metadata` part must contain the following additional property:
          - `profilePropertyIds`: The profile property ID's that are used for training the model (for example `['browsername', 'interactions_clicked']`).

          Once the model is sufficiently trained, the `featureNames` can be extracted (from a [`DictVectorizer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.DictVectorizer.html)) and used to update the model metadata.<br/>
          The `featureNames` must be defined in the following format and is only required when an ONNX model is provided:
          ```json
          {
            "featureNames": [
              "browsername=chrome",
              "browsername=edge",
              "lastvisitdate",
              "interactions_clicked"
            ]
          }
          ```

          #### ONNX model requirements
          The ONNX model must have the following input names:
          * `variant_ids`: the list of variant IDs to consider in the ONNX model
          * If the model contains a `profile` input name, then the length of the input array should be equal to the length of the `featureNames`.

          The ONNX model must have the following output names:
          * `variant_id`: the variant ID that should be served based on the ONNX model outcome

      requestBody:
        description: |-
          To update a model, a `multipart/form-data` request can be sent to the `/models` endpoint via the `PUT` method. <br/>
          The request body can contain multiple parts, named as follows: <br/><br/>

          - `metadata`: The updated metadata for the model. This is a JSON object that contains the model's metadata properties.
          - `model`: The binary ONNX model, serialized as specified in the ONNX [documentation](https://onnx.ai/onnx/api/serialization.html).

          Both parts are optional, meaning that you can update the metadata without providing a new model, or you can provide a new model without updating the metadata.<br/>
          For the `metadata` part, no partial updates are supported. The entire metadata object must be provided in the request.<br/>
          At least one part needs to be supplied, otherwise a HTTP 400 is returned.

          ### DIALOGUE models

          When updating a model of type `DIALOGUE`, the `metadata` part must contain the following additional property:
          - `profilePropertyIds`: The profile property ID's that are used for training the model (for example `['browsername', 'interactions_clicked']`).

          Once the model is sufficiently trained, the `featureNames` can be extracted (from a [`DictVectorizer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.DictVectorizer.html)) and used to update the model metadata.<br/>
          The `featureNames` must be defined in the following format and is only required when an ONNX model is provided:
          ```json
          {
            "featureNames": [
              "browsername=chrome",
              "browsername=edge",
              "lastvisitdate",
              "interactions_clicked"
            ]
          }
          ```

          #### ONNX model requirements
          The ONNX model must have the following input names:
          * `variant_ids`: the list of variant IDs to consider in the ONNX model
          * If the model contains a `profile` input name, then the length of the input array should be equal to the length of the `featureNames`.

          The ONNX model must have the following output names:
          * `variant_id`: the variant ID that should be served based on the ONNX model outcome

          **Group strategy**

          The following values are valid strategies for group operations. These can be used to create, update or delete groups.

          | Name         | Description                                                                                |
          | :----------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
          | UPSERT   | Will update (and insert if not found) the group based on the rules passed along.           |
          | UPDATE   | Will update (but doesn’t insert if not found) the group based on the rules passed along. |
          | DELETE   | Will delete the group with the given ID.                                                 |

          **Limits**

          * Each request can contain up to 1000 entries. If this limit is exceeded, a HTTP 413 will be thrown (the first 1000 entries will be processed and returned in the response).
          * When too many requests are sent concurrently, a HTTP 429 can be thrown. BlueConic recommends designing your app to be resilient to this scenario. For example, implement a request queue with an exponential backoff algorithm.

          \ through **Timeline event types** tab in BlueConic. In this tab you can\
          \ create a new timeline event type, update, or delete existing ones.\n\n\
          It's possible to add, update, or remove properties and nested properties\
          \ from a timeline event type. The property ID of timeline event property\
          \ can only be changed until it's saved.\nTo update the property ID after\
          \ saving, the property will have to be deleted and recreated with the desired\
          \ ID.\n\n**Timeline events**\n\nEvents are data points tied to the [BlueConic\
          \ Timeline](https://support.blueconic.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035962954-About-Timeline-events-in-BlueConic)\

          \ \nEvents can be HIGH or LOW priority. There is a maximum number of 250\
          \ events per profile allowed.\nLOW priority events have a retention period\
          \ between 1 and 365 days (the default is 30 days).\nHIGH priority events\
          \ have a retention period of 1 day and up.\nThe default is indefinitely;\
          \ however, they are constrained by the total number of events and take precedence\
          \ over LOW priority events, which are capped at 50 if there are 200 or more\
          \ HIGH priority events.\n\n**Privacy legislations and consent management**\n\
          \nAny `objectiveIds` passed in the query string are matched against the\
          \ profile that is being created.\nMatching is done against the special profile\
          \ property `consented_objectives`, which reflects the objective IDs that\
          \ the profile has explicitly consented to. So, for the profile to be created,\
          \ the “properties” should at least contain one of the objective IDs passed\
          \ in the querystring, for the property with id `consented_objectives`. Otherwise,\
          \ the `CONSENT_MISMATCH` state is returned in the response.\n\nThe following\

                      * Zipcodes `02111` and `02112` will be added.
                      * `email` will be set to `jane@example.com.`

              Partial updates for timeline events:
                description: |-
                  An example for partially updating a timeline event:


                  * Will update (or insert if not exists) the order event with the given ID.
                      * `date` is optional and may be omitted, causing all events with the given ID to be updated.
                  * Will add (or update if it exists) a product with id:PRODUCT-5469878987 to product.
                       * Note that the `strategy` can be left empty when the `identifier` is specified.
                  * Will set `quantity` to 2 if the product does not have `quantity` set yet.
                  * Will add `FREETV-CHRISTMAS-SPECIAL` to `coupon` for the product.
                  * Will set `quantity` to 1 for this `order`.

                  Notes on using an `identifier` for nested timeline event properties:

                  * A timeline event type property marked as `identifier` can only contain one value; more values will be ignored (first value is used).
                  * When sending an `identifier` in the bulk API, it cannot be empty.

          \ definition objects may contain filters that restrict the items that will\
          \ be returned. \n\nFormat:  \n`\"filters\": [\"<property ID>\":<absolute\
          \ literal value>,<absolute literal value2>\"]`  \nto only include items\
          \ that have a specific value for a specific profile property.\n\nUse the\
          \ `!` before the property to **exclude** items. Format:  \n`\"filters\"\
          : [\"!<property ID>\":<absolute literal value>,<absolute literal value2>\"\
          ]`  \n\nYou can also use the comparison operators `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` for\
          \ data type number, date time, currency, and decimal properties. \nFor example\
          \ `\"filters\": [\"<property ID>\">=<absolute literal value>,<absolute literal\
          \ value2>\"]`\n\nWhen combining multiple filters, these have an implicit\
          \ AND relation.  \nTo combine filters, follow the format `\"filters\": [\"\
          <property ID>\":<absolute literal value>,<absolute literal value2>\", \"\
          <property ID2>\":<absolute literal value3>,<absolute literal value4>\"].`\n\
          \nProfile property value filtering can be done by explicitly passing an\
          \ absolute literal value. You can’t reference another profile property in\
          \ the filter or use relative dates (for example, 14 days ago).\n\nSee examples\
          \ below.\n\n| Example                                                  |\
